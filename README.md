# MechaCar Statistical Analysis

## Deliverable 1
The analysis gives a p-vale of 5.35e-11, which indicates that we reject the null hypothesis, i.e. the slope is non-zero 

The r-squared is 0.7149, indicating that the MPG prediction is strong.

The variables that are meaningfully contributing to the prediction are the ground clearance and length of the vehicles. 

## Deliverable 2

The variance for the suspension coils is not supposed to exceed 100 PSI. for the total, it is 62.3 - does not exceed. Lot 1 is 0.98 - does not exceed. Lot 2 is 7.5 - does not exceed. Lot 3 is 170.3 - does exceed.

## Deliverable 3 

Total t-test: p-value = 0.06 - greater than significance leve. 
Lot 1 t-test: p-value = 1 - greater than significance level. 
Lot 2 t-test: p-value = 0.61 - greater than significance level. 
Lot 3 t-test: p-value = 0.04 - less than significance level. 

This means that for lot 3 we should reject the null hypothesis - there is a statistical difference.
